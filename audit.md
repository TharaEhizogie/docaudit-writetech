**introduction**
An overview of this repository shows a doc containing blog, pages, src, static and tutorials. This doc is easy to navigate but it's arrangement could be better. There are lots of files with lorem ipsum as their content,while this indicates temporal input, the documentation would be better with actual information
I think this doc is structured well but it would be helpful to have some pages exist as actual pages such as getting started
